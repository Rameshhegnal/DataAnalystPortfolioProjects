## ⭐ Project Highlights (STAR Format)

- **Situation**: PhonePe transaction data lacked structured statistical analysis, making it difficult to interpret payment behavior across Indian regions.
- **Task**: Conduct a statistical review to identify usage trends and visualize transaction volume and mode preferences across geographies.
- **Action**: Used SQL and Excel to clean and analyze data, performed hypothesis testing to compare adoption patterns, and created a Power BI dashboard to visualize region-wise insights.
- **Result**: Delivered a data-driven report that revealed key patterns in regional digital payment behaviors, helping stakeholders prioritize states for business expansion and promotional targeting.
